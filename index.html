            <p class="para">Mother Teresa, born as AnjezÃ« Gonxhe Bojaxhiu on August 26, 1910,
                in Skopje (now in North Macedonia), was a Roman Catholic nun and a truly remarkable humanitarian.
                She dedicated her entire life to serving the poorest of the poor and became a global symbol of 
                selfless compassion and love. Mother Teresa founded the Missionaries of Charity in 1950,
                a religious congregation that continues its charitable work to this day.

            <h4>Early Life and Call to Service:</h4>
            <p class="para">~Mother Teresa was of Albanian descent and spent her early years in Skopje before moving to Ireland and then India, where she lived most of her life.
                <br> ~In 1928, she joined the Sisters of Loreto and received her religious training in Dublin, Ireland, before arriving in Calcutta (now Kolkata), India, in 1929.
               <br> ~While serving as a teacher at St. Mary's High School in Calcutta, she felt a "call within a call" to serve the poor and abandoned.

            <h4> Founding the Missionaries of Charity:</h4>
            <p class="para">
                ~In 1946, Mother Teresa received what she described as a "call within a call" during a train ride to the Loreto convent in Darjeeling. This calling led her to establish the Missionaries of Charity, a congregation dedicated to serving "the hungry, the naked, the homeless, the crippled, the blind, the lepers, all those people who feel unwanted, unloved, uncared for throughout society, people that have become a burden to the society and are shunned by everyone."
                <br> ~The Missionaries of Charity began as a small community with just 13 members but grew rapidly over the years, spreading its service to various countries worldwide.
            </p>

            <h4>Charitable Work and Recognition:</h4>

            <p class="para">
                ~The Missionaries of Charity, under Mother Teresa's guidance, opened numerous hospices, homes for the dying, orphanages, and centers for the destitute and disabled. They also reached out to those suffering from leprosy and HIV/AIDS.
                <br> ~Mother Teresa's personal dedication to the poor and sick was exemplary. She often ministered to individuals personally, providing them with care, comfort, and dignity.
                <br> ~Her tireless efforts to alleviate the suffering of the vulnerable and marginalized earned her global recognition and several prestigious awards, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979.
